# Latin-to-Glagolitic-converter


The **Glagolitic script** is the oldest known Slavic alphabet, created in the 9th century by Saints Cyril and Methodius. It was used primarily in liturgical texts across parts of Eastern and Southern Europe — especially in Croatia, Bulgaria, and other Slavic regions — before being gradually replaced by Cyrillic and Latin scripts. There are three styles of Glagolitic: **angular**, **round (curved)**, and **cursive**.

While Unicode supports the **angular Glagolitic** characters (U+2C00–U+2C5F), it does **not** currently include the **curved** or **cursive** versions of the script.

This tool is a simple Python-based program that allows you to **type curved Glagolitic characters using a standard keyboard**. It acts as a converter from Latin characters to images or representations of their curved Glagolitic equivalents.
